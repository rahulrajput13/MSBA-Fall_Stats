## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

### ANSWER 1 ###

anova(model_1b)
coef(model_1b)
summary(model_1b)

sprintf("The intercept of the linear model = 93.03 and the slope = 39.76. This implies that for every unit increase in display area the weekly sales increases by roughly 40 dollars. However the intercept implies that even with no display area the expected weekly sales would be equal to roughly 93 dollars, which might not be true.")

sprintf("On tranforming the display area size (x-axis) into log values based on Tukey's Bulging Rule, we observed that the relationship seemed more linear than the previous model. The intercept of the linear model = 83.56 and the slope = 319.19. This implies that for every unit increase in the log of display area the weekly sales increases by roughly 320 dollars.")

# Part d #

sprintf("The R^2 value for the second model is greater than the first model, therefore the second model is a better fit for the data. The first model is able to explain 71%% of the variation in the Sales values whereas the second model can explain 81%% of the variation in the Sales values. The p values for the slopes in both the model is highly significant which implies we can reject the null hypothesis that there is no linear relationship between the two variables, and be reasonably confident about the linear relationship for both models. However Model 2 is the better fit")
