## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

# Part G
sprintf("Despite having very similar Adjusted R square values our results from the partial F tests run imply that the model used in part c is worse than the model created in part a. The discrepancy in results is likely caused by the fact that a large proportion of the variance is simply explained by Education level. Including the interaction effect did not affect predicted values and therefore the oveall model was still significant. The model in part c would be more prone to overfitting the data than the model in part a.
        Individual t-tests are also more prone to a Type 1 Error and therefore more sensitive")

sprintf("From the tests performed we can infer that the relationship between mean salary and gender does not depend on Education level. After comparing Adjusted R-squared value for the model regressing Salary on only Education Level and model regressing Salary on Education and Gender, I would go ahead with the model that accounts for both Education and Gender.")

Linear regression models of Advertising on Temperature and Discounts on Temperature are also highly significant.")
